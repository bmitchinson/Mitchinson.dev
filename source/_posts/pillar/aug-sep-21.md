What I've been doing at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/industry-x-index) for the months of August + September.

## What I've worked on

- Created dozens of tickets coinciding with new 2 project kick-offs.
  - Feels good to organize a fresh Zenhub project board with clear acceptance
    criteria / patterns for completing and discussing spikes / making goals
    clear and accessible to the team.
  - Team members expressed that they enjoyed getting to work on the initiatives
    because the work was made so clear.
  - Velocity on these new projects is high ðŸ“ˆ
- Deployed a suite of data ingestion microservices to Azure with Helm,
  k8s, and Terraform
- Setup Github actions to do static code analysis, image publication, and
  deployment with Terraform.
- Setup boilerplate for a Typescript Express API with CI/CD, Linting,
  automatic increased VSCode support, and Jest class mocking structures
  / patterns

## What I'd like to improve

#### Code Reviews

I've read the [google eng practices](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/)
dozens of times now. I feel like when I start a review I ask myself different
questions every time, leaving me with reviews I don't feel super confident in,
that are inconsistent in depth. Would like to start documenting questions I
ask myself when beginning a review.
