For a course in Digital Arts this semester, two friends and I grouped together to
create a multichannel audio circuit for displaying "Chladni Figures" in a project
we called "Laserphonic".

You may have seen these formations on plates such as the one shown above.
We set out to recreate the resonant frequency effects visually using lasers, as
a way for listeners and artists to see a real-time visualization of harmony and
dissonance. We were inspired by Nathan J. Wall, who demoed a similar idea
for an <a href="https://youtu.be/RxzMzSZF_b4?t=99">acoustics project</a> at USF Music Tech in 2012.

# Tools and Software

We used a Motu Ultralight mixer to channel out software instruments in Ableton.
Our audio was a combination of pre-composed elements and improvisational input options
for interactivity. Each channel was connected through our circuit to a small
speaker, covered in a stretched balloon, with a piece of broken mirror fixed to the top.

We earned an A for the presentation, and were very pleased with the final result!
Watching people react to our work and be able to play piano in a new way was great.
