During local hack day this December, I developed an Alexa skill for students to check bus times through campus transportation. It was a solo project I set out to complete in 10 hours, and as of January of 2019, over 30 students are still actively invoking the skill every week.

# Development

The process of building Alexa skills has changed a lot over time, but when this skill was created, the "Skill Builder" was [still in beta](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/02d828b6-3144-46ea-9b4c-5ed2cbfadb9c/announcing-new-alexa-skill-builder-beta-a-tool-for-creating-skills). So instead, I just used an AWS Lambda function to control requests to our transportations API.
</br></br>
I never earned an API key, but luckily, using "XXXX" (the key that was used in the demonstration documentation page), allowed for unlimited requests :). In writing this post, I found their [developer facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bongodevelopers/) and [API documentation](https://api.ebongo.org/), and they've acknowledged the public key and now encourage developers to use it.

# Interacting with the API ● [GitHub](https://github.com/bmitchinson/Bongo-Python/tree/master) ● [Alexa Skill](https://www.amazon.com/Mitchinson-Apps-Bongo/dp/B077X254MN/)

Below is the script I used to interact with the Bongo API. As of January 2019, it still works, so feel free to use it in your own projects.
The lambda function version I used for the Alexa Skill is also available as a separate script on the GitHub repo. It's a great beginners project because it could easily be turned into a full wrapper, and the skill has many more potential improvements, so feel free to make pull requests!
