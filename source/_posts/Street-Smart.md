For the final project in "Internet of Things" last spring, our team created
an API, web app, and Raspberry Pi car sensor. The Pi utilizes an on-board
Diagnostics (OBD) interface and the Overpass API to enable in-cabin alerts
when speeding is detected. All events are forwarded to Firebase, and an Express
API and React App hosted on Heroku provide reports and visualizations of driving
habits and vehicle health.

## [Showcase Poster](https://res.cloudinary.com/dheqbiqti/image/upload/v1561400335/Projects/StreetSmart/SSposter.pdf) ‚Ä¢ [GitHub](https://github.com/bmitchinson/streetsmart)

(We use the free tier of Heroku, meaning the app sleeps every 30 minutes. You
might have to wait a moment for the app to spin up upon initial load:

## The Front End

[Harsh Patel](https://github.com/hhpatel09) and I worked on the Express API and React interface in order
to demonstrate viewing sensor data on a "real-time" map. I tore apart [React Shards](https://designrevision.com/docs/shards-dashboard-lite/),
a well styled site template from Design Revision, to throw together an interface quickly.
I was most proud of my implementation of the real-time map, as that component card
was created from scratch using our API, and [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org).

100% As data from traveling cars is published to Firestore, the map shows updates in real-time. %}

## Car Travel Simulation

To have realistic test data, and to demo to our class, I created a
script for generating car travel data. It simulates driving locations and speeds
along a given route of coordinates based on adjustable driver tendencies, and
uploads to Firebase in time accurate spacing, just like our in-car sensor.
</br></br>
It was great to implement async javascript, but going forward I really want
to use proper modules now that I understand how they work in ES6 a bit better.
Too many functions in one file. This script was created overnight because we were
having so many difficulties getting accurate location data for our sensor, so I'm
proud of what I was able to do in that amount of time.

### In-Car Sensor + Alerts

Our Raspberry Pi ran a script to collect GPS location and utilized the Overpass
API to fetch the speed limit of that location, pair them, and publish them to our
database. Additionally, if an instance of speeding was detected, the Raspberry Pi
lit up an LED to alert the driver. </br></br>

### Awards

Our presentation and live demo earned us one of 3 spots for IoT in "Modern Marvels",
the university's showcase for top projects completed throughout the year.

### Improvements

- Next time I build an API, I'd like to try GraphQL. Our client fetched much
  more data then was necessary, and did client-side filtering that could have been
  accomplished in the API layer.
- We only mocked the user account and lacked any sort of authentication on both the
  database or front end. Integrating tools like OAuth is
  something I need to get a handle on soon.
