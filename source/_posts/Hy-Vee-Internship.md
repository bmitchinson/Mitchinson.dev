This summer I helped build Aisles Online Mobile using React Native, while simultaneously working on our REST API and its GraphQL counterpart. I worked on an agile team made up of 4 devs, 1 QA, 1 UI/UX Designer, PO, Tech lead, and 1 intern (ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„) with standards for TDD, 100% code coverage, and pair programming whenever possible. We released the app in June, and reached 3k users and $86k in grocery sales within the first 2 weeks of launch, and a rating of 4.6 stars in the App Store.</br>

Here's a look into everything I was able to work on and contribute to the Hy-Vee Aisles Online App. The engineers on the team are _incredibly_ talented, so learning from them was a privilege I'm grateful for every day.
