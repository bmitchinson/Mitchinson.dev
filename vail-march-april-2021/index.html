I spent much\nof the last month getting ready for a new Software Engineering position at\nPillar Technologies in Des Monies, as well as working through the loss of a\nfamily member. My start date at Pillar is May 19th, and I can’t wait to begin.\nCurrently I’m taking time off to relax + travel, as well as to do some\ncontracting for a friend’s business.\nWhat I’ve worked on (Technical)\nUsing ffmpeg-fluent and ffmpeg to convert user-uploaded audio to universal\nformats. How to convert and manage codecs and conversion\nUpdating our application to support uploaded audio in addition to in-app\ngenerated audio. (Database -&gt; GraphQL -&gt; Client)\nUsing PlantUML as a way to communicate abstract ideas concretely, and iterate\non design in a traditional code-based merge request process\nLearning how to negotiate salaries, and how to respectfully exit a company\nPresented on how to organize GraphQL schema inside a NestJS based application\n\nLet GraphQL abstract the DatabaseOften my impulse is to have an app’s GraphQL schema mirror the database 1:1.\nRecently, we added a new database table, and it made much more sense to instead\nabstract under an existing GraphQL type.\nIt allowed for flexibility since the resolver now would pull data from more than\none database source. It helped me realize that unless you’re willing to make\nconstant changes to your schema each time the database is altered, having your\nschema align 1:1 with your database makes you miss out on the abstraction\nopportunities offered by GraphQL.\nI think we could have promoted this idea by only resolving the fields that were\nin use on the client. We had resolvers that resolved every field of a table,\neven if it wasn’t in use client-side. If instead, we only added fields when the\nneed on client arose, we’d have a much slimmer + more readable GraphQL schema,\nand it’d be less tempting to make every database field available by default.\nUsing type predicatesType Predicates are cool! Our resolver was handling two possible interfaces, and\nit was nice to find a type-safe way to handle either interface. Earlier in my\ncareer I would have resorted to any so it’s exciting to start reaching\nfurther to see how TypeScript can help. I’d like to take an advanced TypeScript\ncourse sometime soon.\nUsing Type Predicates\nSometimes you can break testsOne sprint I was working on a ticket, and when I finished the AC, some existing\ntests broke. These broke because the ticket was part of a large new\nfeature, and without the remaining tickets completed, tests were going to stay\nbroken.\nI assumed “don’t let tests break”, and took on two more tickets simultaneously,\nin an effort to implement all of the features necessary to make tests green.\nIn retrospect, I don’t think this was the way to go. In the event you’re merging\nto a feature branch and not mainline code, I think it might be okay to break\ntests.\nIf it’s documented (// will be green in TTPSP-189), I think letting them fail\nwill help code review stay small + keep the team moving faster. The expectation\nremains that these tests will be green before reaching mainline code, so if this\nhappens again, I’d like to bring it up to my team to see what they think of the\napproach.\nWhat I’ve Learned (Personal)Working from home -&gt; move around the houseWhile I like my desk setup, I find I’m most productive when I move around the\nhouse. Room, living room couch, kitchen table. Moving around has helped my brain\nstay a lot more focused.\nWhy is the house a messAfter a day of work, I’d look at the kitchen or my room and think “why is it\nsuch a mess here”, and start feeling pretty down. I was home all day, I really\ndidn’t have time to clean? I was home all day, yet there’s nothing ready for\ndinner?\nI was at work! Of course the house is a mess, I haven’t been “home”, I’ve been\nat “work”. Reminding myself of that line has helped me feel better when I end\nwork for the day. Still looking forward to being at an office soon to have a\nphysical representation of that line.\nRealistic estimates, not best caseIt can be tempting for me to give “best case estimates” during standups as a way\nto push myself to get something done as quickly as possible. I’d like to find\nother ways to motivate myself that don’t result in flakey estimations from my\nteam’s perspective.\nGoing forward I’d like to practice giving more likely estimates and working\nto complete them a bit sooner than originally expected, instead of finishing\nright down to the wire or late.\nWhat I’d like to improveCreating tickets for experimentation effortsI’m privileged to be on a team where we’re able to take time and experiment\nwith new ideas. I’ve found that I sometimes give myself too many things to\njuggle: improving a Jenkins step, adding a new cypress improvement,\nexperimenting with a new build tool. It became difficult to track all of these\ninitiatives. I’d like to ticket ideas for refactors / features and make sure\nto note why I find them valuable. Then it’d be a bit more motivating to return\nto existing ideas during free time, instead of endlessly creating new ideas,\nand never completing any.\n26 files changed, pump the breaks.That’s an indication that you might need to slow down and reassess your design.\nResources found / Articles I liked:\nReact Bundles and Code Splitting - Emma Goto\nUsing type predicates\nCapable + Fast UML\n","dateCreated":"2021-05-05T09:34:00-06:00","dateModified":"2022-09-04T20:13:51-06:00","datePublished":"2021-05-05T09:34:00-06:00","description":"What I’ve been doing at Vail Systems for March + April.","headline":"Vail Systems March + April 2021","image":["https://res.cloudinary.com/dheqbiqti/image/upload/fl_progressive,r_50:5/v1620230407/Projects/Vail/vailThumbnailMarchApril.webp"],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mitchinson.dev/vail-march-april-2021/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ben Mitchinson","sameAs":["https://github.com/bmitchinson","https://dev.to/bmitchinson","https://twitter.com/115bwm/","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-mitchinson","/resume"],"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dheqbiqti/image/upload/fl_progressive,w_110/v1532150487/BenMitchinson.com/profile.webp","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dheqbiqti/image/upload/fl_progressive,w_110/v1532150487/BenMitchinson.com/profile.webp"}},"url":"https://mitchinson.dev/vail-march-april-2021/","keywords":"Vail","thumbnailUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dheqbiqti/image/upload/fl_progressive,r_50:5/v1620230407/Projects/Vail/vailThumbnailMarchApril.webp"}</script>

<p><em>Cross posted on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dev.to/bmitchinson/vail-systems-feb-2021-4kbl">dev.to</a></em></p>
<p>What I’ve been doing at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vailsys.com/">Vail Systems</a> for March + April.</p>
<p>Writing for both March and April in this post, so it’s a bit longer. I spent much
of the last month getting ready for a new Software Engineering position at
Pillar Technologies in Des Monies, as well as working through the loss of a
family member. My start date at Pillar is May 19th, and I can’t wait to begin.</p>
<p>Currently I’m taking time off to relax + travel, as well as to do some
contracting for a friend’s business.</p>
<h2 id="What-I’ve-worked-on-Technical"><a href="#What-I’ve-worked-on-Technical" class="headerlink" title="What I’ve worked on (Technical)"></a>What I’ve worked on (Technical)</h2><ul>
<li>Using <code>ffmpeg-fluent</code> and ffmpeg to convert user-uploaded audio to universal
formats. How to convert and manage codecs and conversion</li>
<li>Updating our application to support uploaded audio in addition to in-app
generated audio. (Database -&gt; GraphQL -&gt; Client)</li>
<li>Using PlantUML as a way to communicate abstract ideas concretely, and iterate
on design in a traditional code-based merge request process</li>
<li>Learning how to negotiate salaries, and how to respectfully exit a company</li>
<li>Presented on how to organize GraphQL schema inside a NestJS based application</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Let-GraphQL-abstract-the-Database"><a href="#Let-GraphQL-abstract-the-Database" class="headerlink" title="Let GraphQL abstract the Database"></a>Let GraphQL abstract the Database</h4><p>Often my impulse is to have an app’s GraphQL schema mirror the database 1:1.
Recently, we added a new database table, and it made much more sense to instead
abstract under an existing GraphQL type.</p>
<p>It allowed for flexibility since the resolver now would pull data from more than
one database source. It helped me realize that unless you’re willing to make
constant changes to your schema each time the database is altered, having your
schema align 1:1 with your database makes you miss out on the abstraction
opportunities offered by GraphQL.</p>
<p>I think we could have promoted this idea by only resolving the fields that were
in use on the client. We had resolvers that resolved every field of a table,
even if it wasn’t in use client-side. If instead, we only added fields when the
need on client arose, we’d have a much slimmer + more readable GraphQL schema,
and it’d be less tempting to make every database field available by default.</p>
<h4 id="Using-type-predicates"><a href="#Using-type-predicates" class="headerlink" title="Using type predicates"></a>Using type predicates</h4><p>Type Predicates are cool! Our resolver was handling two possible interfaces, and
it was nice to find a type-safe way to handle either interface. Earlier in my
career I would have resorted to <code>any</code> so it’s exciting to start reaching
further to see how TypeScript can help. I’d like to take an advanced TypeScript
course sometime soon.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates">Using Type Predicates</a></p>
<h4 id="Sometimes-you-can-break-tests"><a href="#Sometimes-you-can-break-tests" class="headerlink" title="Sometimes you can break tests"></a>Sometimes you can break tests</h4><p>One sprint I was working on a ticket, and when I finished the AC, some existing
tests broke. These broke because the ticket was part of a large new
feature, and without the remaining tickets completed, tests were going to stay
broken.</p>
<p>I assumed “don’t let tests break”, and took on two more tickets simultaneously,
in an effort to implement all of the features necessary to make tests green.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I don’t think this was the way to go. In the event you’re merging
to a feature branch and not mainline code, I think it might be okay to break
tests.</p>
<p>If it’s documented (<code>// will be green in TTPSP-189</code>), I think letting them fail
will help code review stay small + keep the team moving faster. The expectation
remains that these tests will be green before reaching mainline code, so if this
happens again, I’d like to bring it up to my team to see what they think of the
approach.</p>
<h2 id="What-I’ve-Learned-Personal"><a href="#What-I’ve-Learned-Personal" class="headerlink" title="What I’ve Learned (Personal)"></a>What I’ve Learned (Personal)</h2><h4 id="Working-from-home-gt-move-around-the-house"><a href="#Working-from-home-gt-move-around-the-house" class="headerlink" title="Working from home -&gt; move around the house"></a>Working from home -&gt; move around the house</h4><p>While I like my desk setup, I find I’m most productive when I move around the
house. Room, living room couch, kitchen table. Moving around has helped my brain
stay a lot more focused.</p>
<h4 id="Why-is-the-house-a-mess"><a href="#Why-is-the-house-a-mess" class="headerlink" title="Why is the house a mess"></a>Why is the house a mess</h4><p>After a day of work, I’d look at the kitchen or my room and think “why is it
such a mess here”, and start feeling pretty down. I was home all day, I really
didn’t have time to clean? I was home all day, yet there’s nothing ready for
dinner?</p>
<p>I was at work! Of course the house is a mess, I haven’t been “home”, I’ve been
at “work”. Reminding myself of that line has helped me feel better when I end
work for the day. Still looking forward to being at an office soon to have a
physical representation of that line.</p>
<h4 id="Realistic-estimates-not-best-case"><a href="#Realistic-estimates-not-best-case" class="headerlink" title="Realistic estimates, not best case"></a>Realistic estimates, not best case</h4><p>It can be tempting for me to give “best case estimates” during standups as a way
to push myself to get something done as quickly as possible. I’d like to find
other ways to motivate myself that don’t result in flakey estimations from my
team’s perspective.</p>
<p>Going forward I’d like to practice giving more likely estimates and working
to complete them a bit sooner than originally expected, instead of finishing
right down to the wire or late.</p>
<h2 id="What-I’d-like-to-improve"><a href="#What-I’d-like-to-improve" class="headerlink" title="What I’d like to improve"></a>What I’d like to improve</h2><h4 id="Creating-tickets-for-experimentation-efforts"><a href="#Creating-tickets-for-experimentation-efforts" class="headerlink" title="Creating tickets for experimentation efforts"></a>Creating tickets for experimentation efforts</h4><p>I’m privileged to be on a team where we’re able to take time and experiment
with new ideas. I’ve found that I sometimes give myself too many things to
juggle: improving a Jenkins step, adding a new cypress improvement,
experimenting with a new build tool. It became difficult to track all of these
initiatives. I’d like to ticket ideas for refactors / features and make sure
to note why I find them valuable. Then it’d be a bit more motivating to return
to existing ideas during free time, instead of endlessly creating new ideas,
and never completing any.</p>
<h4 id="26-files-changed-pump-the-breaks"><a href="#26-files-changed-pump-the-breaks" class="headerlink" title="26 files changed, pump the breaks."></a>26 files changed, pump the breaks.</h4><p>That’s an indication that you might need to slow down and reassess your design.</p>

                        <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>This year for Mother’s Day, I decided to take an old digital photo frame we had lying around the house, and throw in some improvements. Originally, the frame had a small amount of internal memory, and could store low-resolution images loaded in from a flash drive. The process of moving files over was tedious, and I wanted anyone in my family to be able to easily contribute to the rotation of photos. Going away from school, I thought it would be neat to be able to easily update the frame with new photos, no matter where my siblings were in the world.

You may have seen these formations on plates such as the one shown above.
We set out to recreate the resonant frequency effects visually using lasers, as
a way for listeners and artists to see a real-time visualization of harmony and
dissonance. We were inspired by Nathan J. Wall, who demoed a similar idea
for an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/RxzMzSZF_b4?t=99">acoustics project</a> at USF Music Tech in 2012.

I've been with the org for two years now, and immediately after my first semester of volunteering, I applied for a position on the board. I knew right away that the club was something I wanted to participate in throughout my four years at Iowa, and I've held leadership roles within the club ever since. In that time we've grown a ton, so I wanted to share a bit about what we've done for the community, and how we've grown as a student org on campus.

<h3>Our Mission Statement:</h3>
> "Computer Comfort strives to bridge the age gap in Iowa City by educating seniors on today’s technology while building strong relationships in the process."

Our goal was to help kids increase their literary ability, learn relevant topics through current news, and then encourage dialog over those concepts with parents through provided parental controls and data-driven tooling with insight reports.
