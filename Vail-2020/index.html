Here are highlights of what I‚Äôve\nlearned, and what I‚Äôll be working on going forward. The plan is to do one of\nthese a month as quick bullet points, starting in March.\nWhat I‚Äôve worked onOur team of 5 made a full-stack app for translating text and generating corresponding audio.\nLarge quantities of text are imported inside CSVs and then edited\nfurther inside the client React app.\nA NestJS API then resolves translations and audio generation with AWS services,\nstores resulting audio in S3, and maintains transaction data in a Vail MSSQL\ndatabase.\nTechnology used:\nReact (CRA) / Yarn\nTypescript (monorepo shared typings)\nNode / NestJS / GraphQL\nCypress / react-testing-library\nNock / CucumberJS\nDataGrip + KnexJS\nJenkins + k8s\nDocusaurus\n\nWhat I‚Äôve Learned (Technical)Make TDD work for youI‚Äôve found that TDD is intimidating for some developers, especially in\nclient-side testing. I used to think that to do TDD, I had\nto have every single assertion down ahead of time. That‚Äôs not the case. Just\nmake a test case with a proper title, and if you‚Äôre stuck, write out assertions\nin a comment:\n// when clicked, the button will turn blue\nDon‚Äôt let assertions distract you from the purpose of TDD: to have a clear\nachievable goal while coding + making decisions. You can still fulfill that purpose\nwithout syntax perfect assertions. After writing enough tests, assertions\nwill come more naturally.\nStarting an app from scratchI‚Äôve been fortunate to start working on a product from its start and\nit‚Äôs taught me more than I can write here, but some days I wasted time by trying\nto add as many new + exciting tools as possible. After focusing on core\nframework functionality and less added tooling, we were able to K.I.S.S\n(keep it simple stupid üíã). Now, we have many more options and choices for what\nwe‚Äôd like to add when implementing new features because we‚Äôre not limited by\n1000x external dependencies. Shout-out to my team lead Nav for helping set those\nrestraints.\nJenkins + DockerMaintaining / configuring a mono repo in Jenkins with dynamic tests for linting,\ncomponent + integration at both the UI and API layers, and e2e.\nAuthWe implemented auth several times looking for a technology we liked. Was good to\nunderstand why auth solutions work the way they do and what they protect against\n(XXS, HttpOnly, Secure, Localstorage vs cookies, etc‚Ä¶), as opposed to just how to\nconfigure PassportJS.\nWhat I‚Äôve Learned (Personal)Pairing remoteIt‚Äôs been good to practice:\n\ngiving a pairing partner space to consider a problem while on a call. It‚Äôs\neasy to accidentally interrupt.\nWorking off a shared to-do list helps keep efforts focused when new ideas pop.\nGathering resources / searching online to help solve a problem, while someone\nis actively working on it.\n\nWork balance while working from home\nHow to take a 30-minute mind break to prepare something for dinner, without\nit derailing your entire afternoon.\nTaking breaks away from screens. Video games aren‚Äôt the best break for the\nmind or the eyes.\nHow to work async: Send updates + check in on others. Grateful that my\nteammates are always up for a call / question.\nCreating a work environment: Move your desk into a space dedicated for 9-5\nand change the scenery every once and a while.\nCommunicate with others when struggling! It‚Äôs easy to forget you‚Äôre not in\nit alone.\n\nTaking notes\nWhen someone says ‚Äúhow do we do that again‚Äù, it feels great to fire off a\ndocument / confluence page with a breakdown + meeting summary. Meetings become\n2x as valuable when an artifact exists afterward, especially in a remote\nsetting. I‚Äôm a big fan of docs and making creating documentation part of the\ndevelopment process.\n\nWhat I‚Äôd like to improve (Technical)Client-side performance metrics (web.dev)We don‚Äôt have metrics for many of our operations. I‚Äôd like to find ways to\nincorporate things like ‚Äútime to interactive‚Äù and ‚Äúfirst paint‚Äù in our test\nsuite so that we can find regressions.\nNockSome of our tests interact with AWS and cause conflicts when running tests on\nmultiple branches. I‚Äôd like to work on understanding ‚ÄúNock‚Äù and using it to\nreplace AWS calls.\nDocsAreas of our app like authentication and simple things like our implementation\nof recaptcha would benefit strongly from a docs page. I‚Äôd like to practice\nwriting things up on new features as they‚Äôre being implemented. Instead of\ntrying to force myself to do them after they‚Äôve been completed.\nWhat I‚Äôd like to improve (Personal)Following through on new ideas + making ticketsOften I think ‚Äúoh we could improve X by doing Y‚Äù or ‚ÄúHmmm X seems like it‚Äôs performing strangely‚Äù.\nIf those ideas aren‚Äôt related to the task at hand, it‚Äôs easy for me to throw\nthem to the wayside. I‚Äôd like to build a better habit of making actionable\ntickets for those thoughts, or at the bare minimum, noting them down.\nResources found / Articles I liked:\nAtlassian on Remote Work research findings - link\n","dateCreated":"2021-02-15T00:00:00-07:00","dateModified":"2022-09-04T20:13:51-06:00","datePublished":"2021-02-15T00:00:00-07:00","description":"In June of 2020, I started as a full-time Web Software Engineer at\nVail Systems.

<p><em>Cross posted on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dev.to/bmitchinson/6-months-at-vail-systems-1ilj">dev.to</a></em></p>
<p>In June of 2020, I started as a full-time Web Software Engineer at
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vailsys.com/">Vail Systems</a>. Here are highlights of what I‚Äôve
learned, and what I‚Äôll be working on going forward. The plan is to do one of
these a month as quick bullet points, starting in March.</p>
<h2 id="What-I‚Äôve-worked-on"><a href="#What-I‚Äôve-worked-on" class="headerlink" title="What I‚Äôve worked on"></a>What I‚Äôve worked on</h2><p>Our team of 5 made a full-stack app for translating text and generating corresponding audio.
Large quantities of text are imported inside CSVs and then edited
further inside the client React app.
A NestJS API then resolves translations and audio generation with AWS services,
stores resulting audio in S3, and maintains transaction data in a Vail MSSQL
database.</p>
<h4 id="Technology-used"><a href="#Technology-used" class="headerlink" title="Technology used:"></a>Technology used:</h4><ul>
<li>React (CRA) / Yarn</li>
<li>Typescript (monorepo shared typings)</li>
<li>Node / NestJS / GraphQL</li>
<li>Cypress / react-testing-library</li>
<li>Nock / CucumberJS</li>
<li>DataGrip + KnexJS</li>
<li>Jenkins + k8s</li>
<li>Docusaurus</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-I‚Äôve-Learned-Technical"><a href="#What-I‚Äôve-Learned-Technical" class="headerlink" title="What I‚Äôve Learned (Technical)"></a>What I‚Äôve Learned (Technical)</h2><h4 id="Make-TDD-work-for-you"><a href="#Make-TDD-work-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Make TDD work for you"></a>Make TDD work for you</h4><p>I‚Äôve found that TDD is intimidating for some developers, especially in
client-side testing. I used to think that to do TDD, I had
to have every single assertion down ahead of time. That‚Äôs not the case. Just
make a test case with a proper title, and if you‚Äôre stuck, write out assertions
in a comment:
<code>// when clicked, the button will turn blue</code></p>
<p>Don‚Äôt let assertions distract you from the purpose of TDD: to have a clear
achievable goal while coding + making decisions. You can still fulfill that purpose
without syntax perfect assertions. After writing enough tests, assertions
will come more naturally.</p>
<h4 id="Starting-an-app-from-scratch"><a href="#Starting-an-app-from-scratch" class="headerlink" title="Starting an app from scratch"></a>Starting an app from scratch</h4><p>I‚Äôve been fortunate to start working on a product from its start and
it‚Äôs taught me more than I can write here, but some days I wasted time by trying
to add as many new + exciting tools as possible. After focusing on core
framework functionality and less added tooling, we were able to K.I.S.S
(keep it simple stupid üíã). Now, we have many more options and choices for what
we‚Äôd like to add when implementing new features because we‚Äôre not limited by
1000x external dependencies. Shout-out to my team lead Nav for helping set those
restraints.</p>
<h4 id="Jenkins-Docker"><a href="#Jenkins-Docker" class="headerlink" title="Jenkins + Docker"></a>Jenkins + Docker</h4><p>Maintaining / configuring a mono repo in Jenkins with dynamic tests for linting,
component + integration at both the UI and API layers, and e2e.</p>
<h4 id="Auth"><a href="#Auth" class="headerlink" title="Auth"></a>Auth</h4><p>We implemented auth several times looking for a technology we liked. Was good to
understand why auth solutions work the way they do and what they protect against
(XXS, HttpOnly, Secure, Localstorage vs cookies, etc‚Ä¶), as opposed to just how to
configure PassportJS.</p>
<h2 id="What-I‚Äôve-Learned-Personal"><a href="#What-I‚Äôve-Learned-Personal" class="headerlink" title="What I‚Äôve Learned (Personal)"></a>What I‚Äôve Learned (Personal)</h2><h4 id="Pairing-remote"><a href="#Pairing-remote" class="headerlink" title="Pairing remote"></a>Pairing remote</h4><p>It‚Äôs been good to practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>giving a pairing partner space to consider a problem while on a call. It‚Äôs
easy to accidentally interrupt.</li>
<li>Working off a shared to-do list helps keep efforts focused when new ideas pop.</li>
<li>Gathering resources / searching online to help solve a problem, while someone
is actively working on it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Work-balance-while-working-from-home"><a href="#Work-balance-while-working-from-home" class="headerlink" title="Work balance while working from home"></a>Work balance while working from home</h4><ul>
<li>How to take a 30-minute mind break to prepare something for dinner, without
it derailing your entire afternoon.</li>
<li>Taking breaks away from screens. Video games aren‚Äôt the best break for the
mind or the eyes.</li>
<li>How to work async: Send updates + check in on others. Grateful that my
teammates are always up for a call / question.</li>
<li>Creating a work environment: Move your desk into a space dedicated for 9-5
and change the scenery every once and a while.</li>
<li>Communicate with others when struggling! It‚Äôs easy to forget you‚Äôre not in
it alone.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Taking-notes"><a href="#Taking-notes" class="headerlink" title="Taking notes"></a>Taking notes</h4><ul>
<li>When someone says ‚Äúhow do we do that again‚Äù, it feels great to fire off a
document / confluence page with a breakdown + meeting summary. Meetings become
2x as valuable when an artifact exists afterward, <em>especially</em> in a remote
setting. I‚Äôm a big fan of docs and making creating documentation part of the
development process.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-I‚Äôd-like-to-improve-Technical"><a href="#What-I‚Äôd-like-to-improve-Technical" class="headerlink" title="What I‚Äôd like to improve (Technical)"></a>What I‚Äôd like to improve (Technical)</h2><h4 id="Client-side-performance-metrics-web-dev"><a href="#Client-side-performance-metrics-web-dev" class="headerlink" title="Client-side performance metrics (web.dev)"></a>Client-side performance metrics (web.dev)</h4><p>We don‚Äôt have metrics for many of our operations. I‚Äôd like to find ways to
incorporate things like ‚Äútime to interactive‚Äù and ‚Äúfirst paint‚Äù in our test
suite so that we can find regressions.</p>
<h4 id="Nock"><a href="#Nock" class="headerlink" title="Nock"></a>Nock</h4><p>Some of our tests interact with AWS and cause conflicts when running tests on
multiple branches. I‚Äôd like to work on understanding ‚ÄúNock‚Äù and using it to
replace AWS calls.</p>
<h4 id="Docs"><a href="#Docs" class="headerlink" title="Docs"></a>Docs</h4><p>Areas of our app like authentication and simple things like our implementation
of recaptcha would benefit strongly from a docs page. I‚Äôd like to practice
writing things up on new features as they‚Äôre being implemented. Instead of
trying to force myself to do them after they‚Äôve been completed.</p>
<h2 id="What-I‚Äôd-like-to-improve-Personal"><a href="#What-I‚Äôd-like-to-improve-Personal" class="headerlink" title="What I‚Äôd like to improve (Personal)"></a>What I‚Äôd like to improve (Personal)</h2><h4 id="Following-through-on-new-ideas-making-tickets"><a href="#Following-through-on-new-ideas-making-tickets" class="headerlink" title="Following through on new ideas + making tickets"></a>Following through on new ideas + making tickets</h4><p>Often I think ‚Äúoh we could improve X by doing Y‚Äù or ‚ÄúHmmm X seems like it‚Äôs performing strangely‚Äù.
If those ideas aren‚Äôt related to the task at hand, it‚Äôs easy for me to throw
them to the wayside. I‚Äôd like to build a better habit of making actionable
tickets for those thoughts, or at the bare minimum, noting them down.</p>

                        <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>This year for Mother‚Äôs Day, I decided to take an old digital photo frame we had lying around the house, and throw in some improvements. Originally, the frame had a small amount of internal memory, and could store low-resolution images loaded in from a flash drive. The process of moving files over was tedious, and I wanted anyone in my family to be able to easily contribute to the rotation of photos. Going away from school, I thought it would be neat to be able to easily update the frame with new photos, no matter where my siblings were in the world.

You may have seen these formations on plates such as the one shown above.
We set out to recreate the resonant frequency effects visually using lasers, as
a way for listeners and artists to see a real-time visualization of harmony and
dissonance. We were inspired by Nathan J. Wall, who demoed a similar idea
for an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/RxzMzSZF_b4?t=99">acoustics project</a> at USF Music Tech in 2012.

I've been with the org for two years now, and immediately after my first semester of volunteering, I applied for a position on the board. I knew right away that the club was something I wanted to participate in throughout my four years at Iowa, and I've held leadership roles within the club ever since. In that time we've grown a ton, so I wanted to share a bit about what we've done for the community, and how we've grown as a student org on campus.

<h3>Our Mission Statement:</h3>
> "Computer Comfort strives to bridge the age gap in Iowa City by educating seniors on today‚Äôs technology while building strong relationships in the process."
